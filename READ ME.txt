FUTURE WORK: 

1.) In future, I plan on introducing more languages on the bases of which recommendations can be made. 
2.) Will include more features as a part of feature engineering so that the results can be more diverse. 
3.) Introducing a machine learning model in order to do the feature modeling. It can be content based or collaborative model.
